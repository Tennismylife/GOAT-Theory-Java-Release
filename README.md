Thia demo app is based on [this article](http://www.tennismylife.org/the-goat-theory-la-prima-release/) 

The GOAT Theory is a pillar on Tennismylife work, but it is very difficult to implement. In this case we have coded a little subset on the thoery to explain better what we can teach. 

All the GOAT Theory ia a 'question of proportions', simple to say but difficult to do. Using this app is available to touch with our hands the 'dinamic proportions' explained [here](http://www.tennismylife.org/the-goat-theory-una-questione-di-proporzioni/)

The 'proportion questions' explodes in an infinite combinations series, just like a linear clock (not circular) 

finally the last but not the least, the cryptography using a brute force applied to proportions
